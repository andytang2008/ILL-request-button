# ILL-request-button
This javascript code will add ILL request button to Ex Libris Primo and will create a button dynamically to point to iLLiad website.However, this function works well in brief display of primo. In full display of primo, it does not work very well. If someone could contribute that part of code, it will be appreciated.
